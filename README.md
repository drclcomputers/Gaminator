Gaminator
-ver 0.3

Gaminator is an open-source library of Micropython games made to run on a Raspberry PI Pico with a Waveshare 1.3 inch, 240x240, LCD display (with small adjustements, can be used on any display).
Currently, it includes 5 games:
1. Barried Ball - Pong for one player

2. Flappy Pico - Try to avoid the pipes, while flying a red cube (imagine it's a bird)

3. Shooter Man - Control a man willing exterminate as many zombies as he can

This library also includes a testing program to verify if all the controls are working.

I created a simple interface to start any games on the pi pico, without the need to connect to a computer (Note: You'll need a computer to load all the games and other programs).

Future plans:
- Add splash screens when opening the games
- Enhence the visuals of the games (Now, they are very simple with simple geometric figures and basic colors)
- Add sounds and music via a Buzzer Speaker
- Add more games
- Add a battery to power the Gaminator on the go
- Create a case to fit everything inside
